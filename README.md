## Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+ installed on your system
- Claude Desktop application
- Basic knowledge of command line operations

## Installation

### 1. Install UV

UV is a modern Python package installer and resolver that ensures fast, reproducible installations.

```bash
pip install uv
```

### 2. Verify UV Installation Path

Find the exact path where UV is installed:

```bash
where uv  # On Windows
which uv  # On macOS/Linux
```

Take note of this path as you'll need it for the configuration.

### 3. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/claude-mcp-servers.git
cd claude-mcp-servers
```

### 4. Set Up Each MCP Server

Each server is contained in its own directory with the necessary dependencies.

```bash
# For the weather service
cd weather
uv venv
uv pip install -r requirements.txt

# For the LinkedIn scraper
cd ../linkedin
uv venv
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Configuration

### Configuring Local MCP Servers

To configure the MCP servers from this repository on your local machine:

```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "weather": {
            "command": "C:/Users/yourusername/AppData/Local/Programs/Python/Python311/Scripts/uv",
            "args": [
                "--directory",
                "C:/path/to/your/MCP/weather",
                "run",
                "weather.py"
            ]
        },
        "linkedin_profile_scraper": {
            "command": "C:/Users/yourusername/AppData/Local/Programs/Python/Python311/Scripts/uv",
            "args": [
                "--directory",
                "C:/path/to/your/MCP/linkedin",
                "run",
                "linkedin.py"
            ]
        }    
    }
}
```

> 📝 **Note**: Replace the paths in the configuration with your actual paths.

## Usage

After completing the setup, you can start leveraging these powerful extensions with Claude Desktop:

### Weather Service

Ask Claude about the weather anywhere in the world:

```
What's the current weather in New York City?
Will it rain in London tomorrow?
What's the temperature forecast for Tokyo this week?
```

### LinkedIn Profile Scraper

Ask Claude to create detailed professional profile summaries:

```
Create a proper profile page with the details of https://www.linkedin.com/in/parthasap/
Summarize the career trajectory of https://www.linkedin.com/in/anyprofile/
What skills does https://www.linkedin.com/in/someprofile/ have?
```

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Here's how you can contribute:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`
3. Commit your changes: `git commit -m 'Add some amazing feature'`
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin feature/amazing-feature`
5. Open a Pull Request

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

- Verify that all paths in the configuration are correct
- Ensure the Python scripts are executable
- Check if all dependencies are installed
- Review Claude Desktop logs for error messages
- Verify your `.env` files contain the necessary API keys

## Planned MCP Servers

We're actively developing additional MCP servers:

- Document Analysis Tool
- Calendar Integration
- Email Composition Assistant
- Code Repository Analyzer
- Data Visualization Tool



## Using Cloud-Hosted MCP Servers

As an alternative to running MCP servers locally, you can also use cloud-hosted options available through Smithery.ai:

### Automated Configuration for Cloud-Hosted MCP Servers

1. Visit [Smithery.ai](https://smithery.ai/)
2. Find and copy the command for your desired cloud-hosted MCP server
3. Run the command in your computer terminal
4. The MCP configuration file will be automatically updated
5. Restart Claude Desktop to use the new MCP servers

> 🚀 **Pro Tip**: Cloud-hosted MCP servers can complement your local ones, giving you the best of both worlds - local processing for sensitive tasks and cloud services for specialized capabilities without managing infrastructure.
